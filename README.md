### OOPs concepts used:

- Inheritance: Generic classes for game objects and all the
objects inheriting these classes. Basic character and building classes are inherited by all other classes specific to different types of game objects.
- Polymorphism: Multiple functions with the same name but a varying number of arguments used.
- Encapsulation: Class and object-based approach for all the functionality implemented.
- Abstraction: Intuitive functionality like move(), attack(), etc, showing away inner details from the end user.
